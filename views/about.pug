                    |  very small town called Ordway, which is located 1 hour East of Pueblo
                    |  Co. and 2 and a half hours South-East of Denver Co., near the
                    |  Oklamhoma and Kansas border. I am the second oldest of five
                    |  children and moved out to Salt Lake City Utah to attend Neumont
                    |  College of Computer Science. I chose to go to Neumont for technology
                    |  has alway interested me ever since i got my first game console. I then
                    |  chose to be a Web Developer for I love being artistic and have a
                    |  very creative mind. Plus woring with technologies like Node.JS,
                    |  AngularJS, and JavaScript is just to fun to pass up. This is a little
                    |  about who I am. If you would like to know more don't be afraid to
